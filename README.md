# XSSer ‚Äì Automated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Tool

**XSSer** is an open-source tool for detecting and exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. It automates XSS discovery and supports multiple attack vectors including DOM, GET, POST, and even custom payloads.

## üîç What Can XSSer Do?

- Detect reflected, persistent, and DOM-based XSS
- Test GET, POST, and custom parameters
- Encode payloads in multiple formats (Base64, HEX, etc.)
- Bypass WAFs and filters using tampering techniques
- Use custom scripts and fuzzing options
- Export results to reports or log files

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

```bash
xsser -u "http://target.com/page.php?query=test"
```

This scans the `query` parameter for possible XSS vulnerabilities.

| `--all`                     | Use all tests including persistent and DOM XSS               |
| `--fuzz`                    | Fuzz parameter locations to find injection points           |
| `--payload "<script>"`      | Use a custom XSS payload                                     |
| `--Hex`, `--Str`, `--B64`   | Encode payload in HEX, STR, or Base64                       |
| `--WAF`                     | Enable WAF bypass modes                                      |
| `--file <file>`             | Load list of URLs to test                                    |

## üß™ Examples

### Basic GET scan
```bash
xsser -u "http://example.com/search?q=term"
```

### POST form injection with data
```bash
xsser -u "http://example.com/login" --data "username=admin&password=123"
```

### Use custom XSS payload
```bash
xsser -u "http://target.com/page.php?input=1" --payload "<script>alert(1)</script>"
```

### Fuzz and use WAF bypass
```bash
xsser -u "http://testsite.com/page.php?id=2" --fuzz --WAF
```

### Encode payload with Base64
```bash
xsser -u "http://target.com/input" --payload "<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>" --B64
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- XSSer is aggressive; use only with **explicit permission**.
- Encoding and tampering may help bypass WAFs or poorly filtered apps.
- Use `--auto` or `--all` to run wide scans, but expect slower performance.
